# DnDHealthTracker

D&D Health Tracker is a small Android app to track your D&D character's health during combat. 
It really only does that and is meant for paper-only tables where you do not have your character
sheet digitally available. 

I myself find it hard to track my HP on paper, especially during long fights. 

Feel free to download and build this app yourself. Also consider using another icon, since my
design skills are comparable to those of a five years old.
